# CodeLyoko-Legacy
This project is just done out of love for the show _"Code:Lyoko"_ 


Currently this is under development, most of it is done but
I'm having some trouble with some things, so any help would be greatly appreciated


If you wish to download the mod's jar or it's sources
check in the releases

or at the curse forge page at

# FOR CONTRIBUTORS

just clone the branch and make your own branch and submit a pull request if need be

there's not really any hard and fast rules besides a few programming conventions

   1. if a variable never changes outside of it's initalization always add the final keyword to it (this includes local variables)
   2. **ALLWAYS** try to document code when possible
   3. obviously make sure there are no errors in the IDE or otherwise
   4. prefer inline declaration if possible to avoid the need for local variables 

The only other thing I can think of is prefer the use of IDEA Intellij over Eclipse,
the project files included/the gradle runs etc. are already primed for Intelli, it's possible to use it in eclipse but you'd have to do
extra work to exclude un-needed changes to certain files

# NOTE FOR CONTRIBUTORS
   just a heads up, when I review the code every now and again I will change it somewhat to do some optimization. I know
   i'm a code performance nut ok.
