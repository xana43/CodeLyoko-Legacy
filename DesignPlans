Feature flow
    - metal refinement system for the super calculator
            - start with the basics like copper etc, and then work your way up tp UV etching silicon chips
    - Allow the super calculator to store each player's information and profile settings
            - basically make a proper computer in minecraft
    - Multiblock refactoring
            -Currently the only MultiBlock structure is the scanner, and it's for the most part
            using manual checking, this needs to be refactored to be automatic
    - Dimension travel
            - there's already a hardcoded way that the scanners get the player to each dimension, but that needs to
            tie in with the super calculator and allow for way towers to teleport players to other sectors
            plus allow for the skid to come accross Replikas
    -Story
            - make a sort of story based progression via journals and generated ruins
Feature Flow Breakdown
    -Beginning
        - create basic computer components with iron, and anything else that's part of the tag
        - once those have been created, find other story entries that allows for the player to know the recipes
        - Tiered lyoko profiles
                - so like if you're using a classical computer A. you can only have 1 scanner active at a time
               B. the total life points of each class is lower, and there's less features in general
               like no way tower access ability, sector 5 can't be accessed, etc and each tier would add more features
    - End game
        - Try to destroy Xana as by this time Xana should be able to spawn monsters in the overworld
        that can only really be dealt with by deactivating xana controlled towers
Class structure
    Each player can be of any class (I.E. Samurai, Warrior, Ninja, Guardian, Feline) all based off of the
    OLD codelyoko facebook game. Each class will have it's own skills
        - Ninja, runs a tiny bit faster, can use the digital fans, can use telekinesis
        - Guardian, has more hitpoints and more defense, can glide, can use Energy balls and create temporary walls
        and bridges
        - Feline, can wall run, run a lot faster, can use the laser arrow, takes no fall damage
        - Samurai, can use super sprint, can use the digital katana, can use triplicate to confuse enemies
        - Warrior, can use the Zweihander, moves a bit slower, can deal MUCH more damage from all melee sources
    Each class will also be able to summon their respective vehicles
        - Samurai can summon the Over bike
        - Ninja and Guardian can summon the Over Board
        - Feline can summon the Hover board
        - Warrior can summon a digital manta
Enemy definition
        All the enemies present from Season 1 - 4 will be added
        - Megatank, Super high defense and health, needs to stop in order to attack and can be easily baited to roll
        off the edge of the sector

       - Krab, can climb on walls, attack the fastest out of all of the other monsters
       - Kankrelat, very weak and simple but spawn in big groups
       - Blok, can use multiple elemental attacks such as ice, fire, poison, insant damage, wither etc
       - Tarantula, slow moving and needs to stop to attack as well, but focues more on supressing fire
       - Hornet, Manta, effectively the same enemy except that mantas can traverse the digital ocean
       - Schithozoa, able to take away a player's ability from respawning in the Over world and the player
       can only respawn in lyoko until they get their respawn key back
Vehicle definition
       for the most part all the vehicles are the same
       - Hoverboard, Overboard, Over bike, can all fly but the overbike can also have gravity
       - Skidblanir, able to hold up to 5 players, can be used to travel in the digital ocean
